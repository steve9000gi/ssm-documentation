<h3>Key to Filenames for .json Files Extracted from the SSM Database</h3>
<h5><em>2016-09-07</em></h5>

The Bash shell script extractMaps.sh pulls each System Support Map .json file
out from the Postgresql database on the server and writes it to a .json file.
Each filename is:

\<state>\_\<affilsa>\<affilfm>\<affilhp>\<affilep>\<affilss>\<affillos>\_\<em>\<id>.json

where the generic names inside the \<brackets> have the following values (all
except \<id> are what the user entered on the System Support Map Wizard's
"Create a New Account" page):

\<state>: "State/Territory/Country" 

\<affilsa>: "Self Advocate" affiliation: single character 't' if user selected
this check box, 'f' if blank

\<affilfm>: "Family member/Representative" affiliation: 't' or 'f' as above

\<affilhp>: "Health Provider or Professional" affiliation: 't' or 'f'

\<affilep>: "Education Provider or Professional" affiliation: 't' or 'f'

\<affilss>: "State Maternal Child Health Agency Staff" affiliation: 't' or 'f'

\<affillos>: "Community-Based or Local Organization Staff" affiliation: 't' or 'f'

\<em>: "Email address" up to but not including the '@' sign

\<id>: The unique integer identifier for this specific map.

Example: 

* State/Territory/Country: "North Dakota"
* "Self Advocate": not selected
* "Family member/Representative": not selected
* "Health Provider or Professional": selected
* "Education Provider or Professional": selected
* "State Maternal Child Health Agency Staff": selected
* "Community-Based or Local Organization Staff": not selected
* Email address: "bob_johnson.77@interop.org"
* Map id: 654

filename: NorthDakota_fftttf_bob_johnson.77_654.json

If Bob subsequently creates a second map with id = 765, the resulting filename
will be NorthDakota_fftttf_bob_johnson.77_765.json.

Note that all blanks have been removed from the filename: some systems don't 
handle filenames with spaces in them, in particular the CentOS (Linux) operating
system that hosts the server, the database, and the extractMaps.sh shell script.
