<h3>Get Mental Maps</h3>

<p>
get_mental_maps.py: Retrieve and write as .json files all the system support
maps (ssms) from the ssm database that are generated from the website
http://syssci.renci.org/ssm-wizard-mental-health-in-schools/. Source for this
website is available at
https://github.com/steve9000gi/ssm/tree/wizard-mental-health-in-schools. 
</p>

<p>Usage:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get_mental_maps.py output_directory</p>
</p>

<p>Arg:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output_directory: a directory into which all the ssm .json files are to be written. If it doesn't exist it will be created.
</p>


<p>
The "SELECT * from maps" statement returns a list of tuples. Each tuple is
an ssm plus its associated metadata and is comprised of the following elements: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>index</th>
<th>type</th>
<th>contents</th>
<th>column name in database</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>int</td>
<td>map id</td>
<td>id</td>

<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>int</td>
<td>owner id </td>
<td>owner</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>dict</td>
<td>the ssm</td>
<td>document</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>datetime</td>
<td>created timestamp</td>
<td>created_at
</tr>

<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>datetime</td>
<td>last modified timestamp</td>
<td>modified_at
</tr>

<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>str</td>
<td>map name</td>
<td>name</td>
</tr>

<table>
</p>

<p>
The tuples in the list are sorted in ascending order of the elements with 
index 4 (last modified timestamp).
</p>

<p>
The element at index 3 in each tuple in the list is a dict which contains
the actual system support map. For the purposes of this study we're
interested only in those dicts which contain a "schoolLocation" key
because only those database elements are generated by the website custom-
modified for the "Roles in Mental Health Care within Schools in Connecticut"
research study.
</p>

<p>
For each one of those ssms that meets this criterion, print some useful
tracking info to stdout and write the dict to file in .json format.
