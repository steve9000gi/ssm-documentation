Instructions for using the Sort web page

I. Generating Input for Sort

1. Build a set of ssm .json files with syssci.renci.org/ssm (https://github.com/steve9000gi/ssm)
and put them all into a directory on your local machine.

2. From the bash shell command line run R script blm.R (https://github.com/steve9000gi/binary-link-matrix)
with two arguments: the first argument is the path, relative or absolute, to that directory full of
ssm .json files that you created in step 1 above; the second argument is the path to an output
directory. The output of blm.R is a set of .csv files each of which contains the binary link
matrix for one of the ssm .json input files, and which has the same name as its corresponding input
file, with the original extension replaced by "-BLM.csv". Also generated is a single file for the
whole ssm input directory, called NodeClasses.csv by default (rename it as you like), that organizes
all the node names from all the ssm input files into lists, by node type. So the names for all the
Role nodes will be listed under the heading "ROLES:", the names for all the Responsibility nodes
will be listed under the heading "RESPONSIBILITIES:", etc. Other than that, the ordering of node
names is arbitrary.

II. Sort

Open syssci.renci.org/sort in Chrome or Firefox. Drag and drop the NodeClasses.csv file generated
in step 2 above into the sort window. A numbered list of node names, organized by node type, will
appear on the left-hand side of the browser window.

Create boxes by clicking on the "New Box" button.

To set the title of a box, click on "Title" at the top left of the box, type in the title desired,
click elsewhere in the window (or in Chrome hit the <Escape> key) to keep the title. Do this to
change the title at any time.

Drag items from the left-hand column of items into the box where you want them. When you hover
over or drag a text item it turns magenta. When it's droppable into a box the text turns bright
green. Release the mouse button and in it goes.

If more space in the window is needed for boxes, shift-drag to scroll the window to the right.

Shift-click on a text item inside a box to remove it from that box and restore it to its former
location in the list on the left.

Save your work by clicking on the "Save JSON" button, which brings up a standard file save
dialog. The JSON output file that results is named SortedItems.json by default, but call it what
you wish. Click on "Save Text" to get a text file version.

These instructions can be displayed by clicking on the "Help" button.
