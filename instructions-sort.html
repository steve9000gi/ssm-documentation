  <h1>Instructions for using the Sort web page</h1>
  <h2>Generate Input for Sort</h2>

  <p>1. Build a set of ssm .json files with the
  <a href="http://syssci.renci.org/ssm">System Support Mapper</a>
  and put them all into a directory on your local machine.</p>

  <p>2. From the bash shell command line run R script blm.R (available with explanation
  <a href="https://github.com/steve9000gi/binary-link-matrix">here</a>)
  with two arguments: the first argument is the path, relative or absolute, to that directory full
  of ssm .json files you created in step 1 above; the second argument is the path to an output
  directory. The output of blm.R is a set of .csv files each of which contains the binary link
  matrix for one of the ssm .json input files, and which has the same name as its corresponding
  input file, with the original extension replaced by "-BLM.csv". Also generated is a single file
  for the whole ssm input directory, called NodeClasses.csv by default (rename it as you like),
  that organizes all the node names from all the ssm input files into lists, by node type. So the
  names for all the Role nodes will be listed under the heading "ROLES:", the names for all the
  Responsibility nodes will be listed under the heading "RESPONSIBILITIES:", etc. Other than that,
  the ordering of node names is arbitrary.</p>

  <h2>Sort</h2>

  <p>&#x25BA Open syssci.renci.org/sort in Chrome or Firefox. Drag and drop the NodeClasses.csv file
  generated in step 2 above into the sort window. A numbered list of node names, organized by
  node type, will appear on the left-hand side of the browser window.
  
  <p>&#x25BA Create boxes by clicking on the "New Box" button.</p>

  <p>&#x25BA To set the title of a box, click on "Title" at the top left of the box, type in the title
  desired, click elsewhere in the window (or in Chrome hit the Escape key) to
  keep the title. Do this to change the title at any time.</p>
  
  <p>&#x25BA Drag items from the left-hand column of items into the box where you want them. When you hover
  over or drag a text item it turns magenta. When it's droppable into a box the text turns bright
  green. Release the mouse button when the text is green and it's moved into that box.</p>

  <p>&#x25BA If more space in the window is needed for boxes, shift-drag to scroll the window to the
  right.</p>

  <p>&#x25BA You can move a box around by click-dragging it.

  <p>&#x25BA Shift-click on a text item inside a box to remove it from that box and restore it to its former
  location in the list on the left.</p>

  <p>&#x25BA Save your work by clicking on the "Save JSON" button, which brings up a standard file save
  dialog. The JSON output file that results is named SortedItems.json by default, but you can rename
  it.  Click on "Save Text" to get a text file version.</p>

  <p>&#x25BA These instructions can be displayed by clicking on the "Help" button.</p>
